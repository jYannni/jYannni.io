Over the past few weeks I have been working on a discord clone. This has been primarily to test myself and improve my skills in creating a application that has been both exciting to code while also having real-world use cases; exploring how to integrate and incorporate essential functionalities using Next.js, Typescript, and React, packed with modern features such as seamless authentication through a login portal by Clerk, a convenient monthly or annual subscription payment system from Stripe, and a set of robust messaging functionalities including group chat, audio and video calls, and direct messaging.

### Typescript and React

I have been utilising Next.Js, React and Typescript, a powerful combination for building a robust web application. Next.Js has provided a fantastic framework for building a server-rendered React application, with ease I may add. Typescript has brought static typing to my JavaScript, allowing me to write quality code and imporove my productivity. React on the other hand, has simplified the UI development with its component-based architecture, declaritive syntax and the strong community support, leading to highly efficient building of an interactive UI and managing state changes seamlessly.

### Real-Time Chat and Calls

The heart of the Discord clone is its communication features. Using WebSocket technology for real-time messaging, I have been able to create chat rooms where users can exchange text messages, share media files, and engage with one another. Additionally, I have able to integrate WebRTC to allow me to implement audio and video calls, this has enabled users to connect with one another, seamlessly, without leavbing the platform.

### Clerk Integration for User Authentication

One of the key components of any modern web application is user authentication. I have used Clerk to provide a hassle-free way to integrate authentication into my Discord-clone, this has allowed for users to sign up using their email address like normal, however Clerk also offer the possibility to authenticate new users through any number of their 24 options - I chose to allow, Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft however, they also offer Github, X, LinkedIn, Coinbase, Spotify, and even Discord (funny that) to name a few. Currently I use their free service as the paid platfrom starts at £25 a month, alllowing for the addition of Password complexity requirements, the ability to ban users, the setting of custom session durations, the use of SMS authentication codes, an Allowlist / Blocklist, and Unlimited social connections and the removal of Clerk branding, but this can easily soar above £100 with some add-ons (Multi factor auth, Multi-domain authentication, Simultaneous sessions, Device tracking and revocation, SAML authentication is one bundle that costs £100/month on its own and they have three bundles,each at £100/month) they have available. Some of these are very useful, and I do understand why they would cost a significant amount for me to implememnt onto my app, they provide a necessary service to leave only the option for authentic accounts to be created and users to sign-up. Maybe if the app requires it further down the line, I would use these services, but for the moment, just simply blocking disposable email addresses, and requiring the new users to add their first and surnames as a safety precaution will suffice.

### Payment management via Stripe

The monetisation of any web application is crucial for long-term sustainability, even if the app starts out with a low-cost payment plan, it will allow me to continue to code and build upon the product, and Stripe makes it a breeze to accept online payments. By integrating Stripe into the discord clone, I am able to set up a subscription plan allowing for membership to become a "plus" and "premium" feature; it also allows me to accept one-time payments for virtual goods, and manage customer billing information securely - I do not want to have to deal with the insanely difficult task of looking after payment information, as this could lead to legal issues if not done correctly. Stripe's developer-friendly documentation and robust API has allowed me to implement payment functionality very easily, becoming a straightforward task and essential to any new application.

### Component Versatility through Tweaking and Reusing

One of the greatest benefits of building the Discord clone with Next.Js, Typescript, and React is the flexibility that it has offered me to tweak and reuse components across multiple areas of the app. Whether I want to customise the UI to match the branding of a product or service, adding new features like the use of emojis in (and reactions to) the messages or file sharing, the ability to optimise performance of the app on mobile devices, the modular nature of React components has made it easy to extend and adapt my app to meet my ever-evolving requirements.

### Elevating Communication Experiences

From integrating Clerk for seamless user authentication to managing payments with Stripe, and empowering real-time communication with WebSocket technology, my journey in creating a Discord clone using Next.Js, Typescript and React has been nothing short of transformative, By being able to harness the power of modern web technologies and third-party services, I have not just built a robust platform, but also unlocked a plethora of skills and new possibilities for my future projects and applications; armed with the knowledge I have gained from this endeavour, I'll continue to push myself and the boundaries of what is possible in web development, while crafting engaging and immersive experiences that redefine the way people can connect and collaborate with each other online.
